    "- **My Question 1: When I currently call .size(), why is it O(n)? What is the function doing that takes linear time**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If I have 1 item or 1,000 items in the stack, this loop runs 1 time or 1,000 times\n",
    "- So, the `.size() method` literally walk through every single node from the top to the bottom to count how many there are. \n",

    "    - The time it takes grows directly with how many nodes(items) I have.\n",

    "- **My Question 2: What could I do to avoid walking through every item just to get the size?**\n",
    "    - I could store in a variable? If I keep track of the size as I go, I dont have to loop through the stack to calculate it every time.\n",
    "- **But when will we need to update that variable?**\n",
    "- **What actions chnage the size of the stack? Push Increases the size and Pop decreases the size.**\n",
    "- **Where should I actually store this variable in the `class` so itâ€™s always accessible?**\n",
    "    - My guess would be to store it in the `Stack class` as an attribute so it is available throught the object's lifecycle.\n",

    "    - Whether the stack was empty or already had items, I've now added one more item so increase the counter by 1.\n",
