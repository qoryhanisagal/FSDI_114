    "\n",
    "- The function correctly identified balanced strings like `\"()\"`, `\"({[]})\"`, and `\"{[()]}()\"` as `True`.\n",
    "- It also correctly failed fast on unbalanced cases such as `\"{[(])}\"` and `\"{[}\"`, returning `False`.\n",
    "- The early return for empty strings worked as expected: `\"\"` returned `True`.\n",
    "- Unmatched single brackets `\"(\"` and `\")\"` immediately returned `False`, demonstrating the efficiency of early exits.\n",

    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- The stack-based approach successfully handles both balanced and unbalanced inputs.\n",
    "- Early exit optimizations (length check and empty stack on closing bracket) reduce unnecessary processing.\n",
